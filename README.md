# Building a program

The library is used as a basis for the program [Win32++](https://win32-framework.sourceforge.net),  and also a library [sqlite3]([GitHub - sqlite/sqlite: Official Git mirror of the SQLite source tree](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite)). Static linking is used when building the program. The sqlite library is built statically using [vcpkg]([GitHub - microsoft/vcpkg: C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)). Both libraries used are included in the project repository.
